        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <h3>Who we are</h3>
        <div style="padding-bottom: 40px;">
            We're a team of students and changemakers passionate about sustainability, technology, and community.<br>
            MUGA (Make Used-items Great Again) was born out of a simple question: <br>
            Why do so many great secondhand items go to waste — just because they're hard to resell or redistribute? <br><br>
            We saw the frustration of garage sales with no reach, donation bins overflowing with unsold clothing, and thrift stores buried in inventory they can’t process fast enough. So we decided to do something about it.
        </div>

        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
        <div style="padding-bottom: 40px;">
        To give every item a second chance — by using smart technology to make exchanging secondhand easier, more accessible, and more efficient for everyone
        </div>

        <h3>What we do</h3>
        <div style="padding-bottom: 40px;">
            MUGA is an AI-enhanced online resale marketplace that helps:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Individuals</b> donate or sell used items faster and easier
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Organizations</b> like thrift stores and nonprofits save time and cut costs
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Customers</b> find affordable, high-quality secondhand goods — all in one place
                </li>
            </ul>
            We use tools like <b>Smart Scan</b>, our AI-powered assistant, to automate listings, estimate fair resale prices, and streamline the entire process.
        </div>
        
        <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
        <div style="padding-bottom: 40px;">
            Each year, up to 60% of secondhand items in Canada don't get redistributed efficiently. That's not just a waste of stuff — it's a lost opportunity for sustainability, community connection, and economic relief. <br>
            With MUGA, we're building a future where used items stay in use — not in landfills.
